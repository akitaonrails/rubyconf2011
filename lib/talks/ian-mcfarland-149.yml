:title: Agile Development, Lean UX
:description: ! 'Agile Development: It works. It creates reliable software quickly,
  efficiently and predictably, fosters a sustainable pace, and keeps the cost of change
  constant. But it''s silent on design. Lean UX brings lightweight methods to design,
  helping to mesh design and development into one lightweight process, responsive
  to change, and tuned to deliver products customers will actually use and pay for.
  No matter how great the code is, it''s not great software unless someone cares to
  use it.


  This talk explains how agile development is done at scale, and draws on Ian''s experience
  at Pivotal Labs, and now at Digital Garage. It also emphasizes the criticality of
  good design, and how to integrate the two, and why both agile development and Lean
  UX aren''t just ''nice to have'', but instead are economic necessities.
