:title: Hypermedia - The Missing Ingredient in REST
:description: ! 'REST is an architectural style for distributed systems. However,
  many implementations forget about the <em>distributed</em> part of REST and simply
  map CRUD operations to HTTP verbs in a monolithic application.


  Why not split this up into a truely distributed system, where applications use REST
  for communication? Real REST. Where clients travel on hypermedia routes using the
  REST APIs from the services.


  While discussing the concepts of hypermedia-driven APIs, we''ll explore the Roar
  gem that makes both REST representations and hypermedia fun.'
