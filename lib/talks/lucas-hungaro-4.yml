:title: SOLID through BDD - a practical guide for Rubyists
:description: ! "We already know many of the benefits of using BDD to design our code.
  But there's one thing we should do more: listen to the voice of our test suites.\n\nIn
  this talk I'll show how you can do that as we learn to identify and fix the following
  issues through BDD:\n\n - Identifying lack of OOP and applying SOLID\n - Anemic
  and bloated domains\n - High coupling\n - Low cohesion\n - Overmocking\n\nWe'll
  see how all these problems are intertwined and how to solve them and reap benefits
  like faster test suites, flexible code and reduced maintenance time.\n\nThis is
  a very practical talk and a good knowledge of Ruby is required."
