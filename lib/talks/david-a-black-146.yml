:title_en: Is Ruby Easy?
:description_br: ! 'Ruby has a somewhat mixed reputation when it comes to ease of
  use and accessibility to programmers -- and, oddly enough, to non-programmers. Its
  "magic" and meta-powers are often seen as barriers to entry and progress. At the
  same time, the belief that Ruby is based on a universal POLS (Policy of Least Surprise)
  persists, and it isn''t unusual to hear annoyance expressed when learning Ruby proves
  to be harder than falling off a log. This talk will explore and troubleshoot notions
  of ease of use, intuitiveness, and programmer friendliness, all in relation to Ruby
  the language and Ruby the programming-cultural entity. '
