:title: Better code through UI Design
:description: ! 'Each software has his own particularities but they all have one thing
  in common: their complexity will grow.


  Developers tend to think in models, tables and data structures. They build the software
  from that point of view. Designers tend to think in screens and navigation but normally
  their work only happens at the beginning or at the end of the project.


  In this presentation we''ll discuss, with real samples, how to simplify the code
  through UI design and navigation.  How to avoid diseases like "crudfication" or
  "resourcefication". How not caring about the flow and screens can negatively affect
  your models, controllers, views, javascript and the overall experience of your developers
  and users.'
