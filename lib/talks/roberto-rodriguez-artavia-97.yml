:title: Ruby on Rails Applications without Page Reloading
:description: ! "Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and most Mobile Apps have a Javascript
  FrontEnd that provide for great user experiences and make Traditional Web Apps that
  require page reload after page reload look slow and boring.\n\nUsing Rails 3.1 newest
  additions like Haml, Coffeescript, Saas and the Asset Pipeline it is really fun
  to build beautiful , structured Client Side Application using Javascript Object
  Oriented Programming and Model-View-Controller Frameworks. \n\nIn this session I
  will use Spine.js (an improvement of Backbone.js ) to create a Ruby on Rails 3.1
  App connected to MongoDB with a \"One Page Front-End\" starting at Step One and
  going all the way to deployment in Heroku.\n\nWith these technologies it is posible
  to create Javascript Application backed by Rails that use very similar Syntax to
  Ruby along with Controllers, Models and Views with a modular file structure that
  become concatenated into one production ready javascript file automatically.\n\nSpine
  Add-Ons like Ajax , LocalStorage, View/List Managers, Routes (!#) allow developers
  to implement Hash Tag Routes, Client-Server Syncronization and Offline Access easily.\n
  \nThe presentation will include my own solutions in order to simplify client-side
  testing and development inside containers like a Salesforce.com Page.\n"
