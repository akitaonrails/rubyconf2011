:bio_br: ! 'Nick Sutterer appreciates the beauty of elegant code, and the value of

  open source software. Through his tireless development and advocacy of

  the Cells and Apotomo gems, he has brought the concepts of

  component-oriented UI development to the world of Rails, proving that

  there should be no such thing as a double-render error, and that one

  need not be slave to the great monolithic view mentality. Also, he

  would like to have beer with you.'
