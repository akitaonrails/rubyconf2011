:title_en: Replicating ActiveRecord objects to MongoDB
:description_br: ! "We had to move much of MySQL / Active Record objects to a huge
  MongoDB document. We'll show you the code that makes this happen and share a few
  of the lessons learned. \n\nEver wonder how to migrate from MySQL to MongoDB?  \n\nThis
  is the detail story of how the report generating code of venuedriver.com went from
  providing great business value to taking more than 5 minutes to just generate an
  error. \n\nWe had to generate reports that needed to join 8 tables. This approach
  was ok for the first 2 years of the app, but as we grew our report generating codebase
  became a joke. \n\n"
