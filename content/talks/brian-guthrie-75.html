:title_br: Ruby Software Continuously Delivered and Exhaustively Explained
:title_en: Ruby Software Continuously Delivered and Exhaustively Explained
:description_br: ! 'The Ruby community has driven a lot of technical innovation in
  deployment and configuration management over the last few years, and so the idea
  of delivering high-quality software rapidly should be familiar to many of us. But
  although many of our tools are state-of-the-art, our practices could stand a bit
  of scrutiny. Your friendly neighborhood server admin probably isn''t thrilled with
  running RVM or compiling gems in production, and your nervous project manager is
  asking why deploying constantly is such a great idea anyway. Won''t you just stop
  coding for, like, five minutes and click around the app for a bit, just to make
  them feel better?


  In this talk, the maintainers of two competing continuous integration servers at
  two competing shops lead you on a Socratic tour of the past, present, and future
  of continuous delivery as seen through an Agile Ruby lens. We''ll talk about the
  changing deployment toolchain, the difficulty of evolving code as it''s deployed,
  and how to coach your developers, testers, and client to be "production-ready, any
  time."'
