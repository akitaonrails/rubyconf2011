:title_br: Real Time Rack
:title_en: Real Time Rack
:description_br: At least since node.js everyone knows that real time HTTP responses
  are the next big thing. The secrets of handling incoming requests asynchronously
  with Ruby is not yet far spread among Rubyists, as the internals needed for such
  responses are neither specified nor documented and there is a lack of tools. Still,
  it is possible to use Server-Sent Events, WebSockets and akin with Rack today. This
  talk will demonstrate the underlying technologies and how to use them in your Ruby
  application.
