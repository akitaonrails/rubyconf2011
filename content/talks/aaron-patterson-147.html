:description_br: ! "Starting a holy war is easy, understanding Rails internals is
  not.  In this talk we'll take a look at some of the code that makes Rails tick.
  \ Highlights will include ActiveRecord, connection pooling, resource management,
  and how these impact the request and response life cycle.  \n\nBased on what we

  our development skills, and how this will shape the future of Rails itself!"
