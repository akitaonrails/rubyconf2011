:description_en: ! 'Great teams can build great companies, but the effort that goes into it is rarely linear.
Groupon was built with Ruby on Rails at its core, and growing from thousands to millions of
users in two years is a testament to the power and flexibility of the tools and practices we
chose as a team.  But progress along that path was often a struggle.</p>

<p>This talk will cover how the team in the U.S. adapted our technology stack during an initial
period of immense growth, describing crucial inflection points in our history (the good, and
the bad) and how the architecture and development practices evolved to support those needs.</p>'
