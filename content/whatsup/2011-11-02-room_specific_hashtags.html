During the conference, you can tweet using the hashtag <strong>"#rubyconfbr"</strong>. Beyond that, you will be able to use the special hashtags <strong>"#rubyconfbr_1"</strong> for Room #1 and <strong>"#rubyconfbr_2"</strong> for Room #2. There will be projectors in each room showing this stream and you will be able to have immediate feedback from the audience about the talk you're watching. And you will be able to follow what's going on in the other room. And to see who's the Top User at Twitter, follow the <a href="http://rubyconfbr.socialmetrix.com/" rel="external">SocialMetrix</a> page.
